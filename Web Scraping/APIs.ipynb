       "     'body': \"&gt; How can I prevent this\\n\\nOne of my less-fond memories was going to a town hall when the organization I worked (private juvenile probation provider) for was trying to put a group home into a very small community. One of the old-timers threatened to blast anyone he saw off the property after dark. My boss, a well-intentioned albeit not culturally-astute (he was, oddly enough, from Mass), went into a great discussion on statistics and recidivism and bored the town hall attendees to tears.\\n\\nWe didn't get our zoning variance. So we tried elsewhere, in a more populated enclave, which eventually succeeded. Having been down that process before, I'd suggest you do the following:\\n\\n- Talk to your city council member. Ensure any variance granted limits the number of beds, requires supervisory staff at whatever ratio your state law dictates, and subjects the home to periodic inspections, and that any X number of validated complaints results in the loss of the variance or permitting, etc.\\n\\n- Talk to the people wanting to put in the group home about their site security plan. Do they have cameras? Qualified, tested, on-site staff? An emergency action plan in case somebody gets out? Hourly security checks? Barred egress routes excepting those mandated by fire code? Promise you'll side with them *if* you approve of the site security plan.\\n\\n- Talk to the local PD and ask if they'll be doing site assessments or more frequent patrols. \\n\\n&gt; Or am I worrying too much\\n\\nMaybe, maybe not. My org had one fatality a couple years before I got there (staffer attacked by juvenile). Had a few get out of custody (one jumped out of a moving car, for example; one of our female juvenile facilities lost a resident who clocked a staffer with a frying pan and then ran off with her supervisor from her work-release program. It happens.). Does it increase your risk? Maybe. If there's a good plan in place and the locals are holding the site accountable, I'd argue that the increase in risk is negligible. On the other hand, if it's a sloppy org with a history of losing juveniles in custody, your risk probably goes up.\\n\\nRegardless, you can either try to stop it entirely by going through your zoning / approval process, or - if it seems likely the variance / approval will be granted - see to it that the requisite accountability measures are put in place.\",\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Original Post: \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "&gt; Around 10 years ago my uncle sexually harassed my cousin by touching her breasts and also kissing her on the lips who was around 14 or around that age at the time. My cousin told me about this in 2015 and she broke down when she told me and I felt so bad for her. Her parents know that the uncle has molested her and they told his wife but she didn’t believe my cousins parents. I wondered why her parents didn’t tell the police because I can visibly see that my cousin is traumatised by it and it’s still affecting her till now. \n",
      "&gt; \n",
      "&gt; The uncle has also done strange things to me when I was a child, for example one day he told me to try and convince my mother to let me sleep over at his house. My mother let me sleep at his house and during the night, he came to his daughter’s room where I was laying down and he got on top of me and took my fingers and started biting it. And then he started playing with my lips with his fingers. He also came close to my face because I remember this specific smell that used to come from him; but I can’t remember what happened after that. \n",
      "&gt; \n",
      "&gt; Around 8 years ago, me and my cousin’s (who was molested) family decided to move from that city to get away from that uncle. I had tried forgetting about these things because it filled me with anger towards him. But at the end of last year, in around late December, my family decided to travel to that city for a holiday since we have other family members in that city. Now when we were in that city, I stayed at his house for some time because I’m friends with his daughter. And one day when I was at his house, one of my Aunty came to his house with her baby daughter and said that she’s going out and she’s going to leave her daughter at the house and then she and the uncle’s wife left. It was only me, my sister, my baby cousin, the uncle and his daughter and son left at the house. As soon as my aunties left, he started calling my baby cousin’s name and told her to come to him. She didn’t go to him so he came and got her then went into the living room and made her sit on his lap. At this point I was freaking out because even if he wasn’t doing anything to her, in my mind he was a creep who’d do nasty things to children. So I tried calling my cousin (the one he molested) on the phone but she wouldn’t pick up. I was so scared and I felt so guilty for letting my little cousin stay with him when no one was around. I tried to secretly look at what he was doing but all I saw was that she was on his lap and he was rubbing her legs. I don’t know if he was going it in a disgusting way or not. I stopped looking because I didn’t want to be caught. Maybe I am overreacting because maybe he didn’t do anything to her but what if he did. I just feel so bad. Another thing that is making me feel bad and guilty is that when I was at his house, he spoke to me a couple of times and I replied back to him in a nice way. This just makes me feel like I betrayed myself and my cousin. \n",
      "&gt; \n",
      "&gt; I wasn’t going to tell the police because I’m not sure if my cousin would like them to know. However, couple of months ago when coming from overseas, at customs the police were going through my bags and they read a note that I wrote to myself. It said “forget about the rape and incest incident that happened 10 years ago, the more you think about it the more bad and paranoid you’d feel” Now when they read this, they didn’t question me but took the piece of paper inside to a room. And after 15 to 20 minutes they came back and gave it to me. Now I have no idea what they did with that paper but I’m scared that they’re going to draw wrong conclusions without actually knowing the truth. I really can’t go tell the police about this without talking about it with my cousin but  I think that she wouldn’t want the police knowing. \n",

Just received the product couple of minutes ago.  Giving 3 stars coz the package was damaged and the sole plate has scratches already at 2 places at the bottom of sole plate (See photos). Working wise, it heated up quite quickly. Would rate 4 stars for that. Bought it for ₹399.	Manjunath J.S.	28 January 2018	Scratches on the sole plate & damaged packing	3.0 out of 5 stars
